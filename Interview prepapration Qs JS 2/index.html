    1)Diff data types in js
--> Premitive and non premitive data type

    1)premitive data types
    number
    null
    boolean
    symbol
    string
    big int  
    undefined

    2)Non premitive
    Object 
    Array 

    2)How many ways we can declare a variable
    three ways
    let
    const 
    var 

    Hoisting is a javascript mechanism where variables and fn declaration moved to top of their scope before the code execution
    only declaration are hoisted not initialisation
    var a; //declaration
    a=10; //initialisation

    Temporary dead zone
    it is the area of block where a variable is anaccessible untill the momemt computer initialise it with value 
    TDZ is associated with let and const.

    diff bt == and ===

    Different types of operators in js
    1.arithmatic operators 
    2.comparison ""
    3.logical ""
    4.relational ""
    5.conditional operators
    6.bitwise ""

From D.Vijay Kumar to Everyone 04:08 PM

1)Let is an  Block scope 
2)Let Cant be Redeclared 
3)Let can be Modified Later

1)Const is an  Block scope 
2)Const Cant be Redeclared 
3)Const cant be Modified Later


Hoisting :Hoisting is a Javascript Mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved 
to top of there scope before the code execution 


Note:Only Declarations are hoisted not the initilizations 


What is an temperal dead zone ?

A)It is the area of a block where a variable is inaccessible until the moment computer initilizes
it with a value 

TDZ occurs when we declare a variable of Let and Const keyword 



What is the Difference between == & === Operator  ?


== only checks the value 
=== checks the both value and the data type 


What are the Different types of Operators in Javascript

1)Arithmetic Operators
2)Comparision Operators 
3)Logical Operators
4)Relational Operators
5)Conditional Operator
6)Bitwise Operator
